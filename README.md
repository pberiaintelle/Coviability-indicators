# Coviability-indicators
The App_demo Google Colab Notebook contains all the script and comments needed to understand the method to compute preliminary coviability change indicators.
For spatial and temporal selection of the data, draw a rectangle over the map and select a range of dates. The script checks the availability of time series data, extracts the time series, and computes coviability indicators from the time series. The computed indicators and the raw data can be visualized for further exploration.
The study area for the project is at the coast of Paraiba. The same code can be used for other areas in Brazil but only the extraction of satellite data and MapBiomas data will be available.
